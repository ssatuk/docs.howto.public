= How to create an account
:experimental:

== Introduction

The following SSAT digital services are all connected to a single sign on (SSO) service - this means you only need to remember one username and password for all of them!

* https://www.ssatuk.co.uk[The Exchange] (member area of SSAT website)
* https://discuss.ssatuk.co.uk[Discussion forums]
* https://lms.ssatuk.co.uk[SSAT Online CPD]

Before you can log in to any of these services you need to create an account in our SSO.

== Registering an Account

IMPORTANT: This section describes the normal method to create a username and password.
If you are planning to use your Google account to authenticate to our services do not follow these instructions.

**Accounts are individual, and everyone at a member school can have one - please don't create shared accounts**   

. Go to the https://identity.ssatuk.co.uk/UserAccount/Register[Register your Details]  page
. Enter the username and password you would like to use and select btn:[Register]

. Please choose an email address that is individual to you, not a role-based address like *admin@myschool.org*
+    
[IMPORTANT]
====
If we have explicitly mentioned an email address that we have in our records for you when inviting you to use a service, please use that email address when registering your account, otherwise you might not be able to access services you 
or your organisation have paid for.
====

. The next stage will take up to a minute while records are created for you.

== Confirming your email

. Check your inbox for the verification email from identity@ssatuk.co.uk (check your spam folder as it might be in there) and click the link - on the page it takes you to enter your password
+
[TIP]
====
If the verification email hasn't arrived within 15 minutes and isn't 
in your junk mail folder, please contact us at help@ssatuk.co.uk for assistance
====
. You will now be able to login to any of the services listed above
. On your very first login you will be asked to accept the Terms and Conditions
